## Introduction

### Description

This library allows you to create CrowdSec bouncers for PHP applications or frameworks like e-commerce, blog or other
exposed applications. It can also be used in a standalone mode using auto-prepend directive.

### Prerequisites

To be able to use this bouncer, the first step is to install [CrowdSec v1](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/getting_started/install_crowdsec/).
CrowdSec is only in charge of the "detection", and won't block anything on its own. You need to deploy a bouncer to "apply" decisions.

Please note that first and foremost a CrowdSec agent must be installed on a server that is accessible by this library.

### Features

- CrowdSec LAPI Support
    - Handle IP, IP ranges and Country scoped decisions
    - Clear, prune and refresh the LAPI cache
    - `Live mode` or `Stream mode`
    - `Api-Key` and `TLS` connection
- Large PHP matrix compatibility: 7.2.x, 7.3.x, 7.4.x, 8.0.x and 8.1.x
- Built-in support for the most known cache systems like Redis, Memcached, PhpFiles
- Events logged using monolog
- Cap remediation level (ex: for sensitives websites: ban will be capped to captcha)



## Usage

When a user is suspected by CrowdSec to be malevolent, a bouncer will either send him/her a captcha to resolve or
simply a page notifying that access is denied. If the user is considered as a clean user, he will access the page as normal.

By default, the ban wall is displayed as below:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/php-lib/screenshots/front-ban.jpg')} alt="Ban wall" title="Ban wall" />

By default, the captcha wall is displayed as below:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/php-lib/screenshots/front-captcha.jpg')} alt="Ban wall" title="Ban wall" />

Please note that it is possible to customize all the colors of these pages so that they integrate best with your design.

On the other hand, all texts are also fully customizable. This will allow you, for example, to present translated pages in your users' language.


### Create your own bouncer

You can use this library to develop your own PHP application bouncer. Any custom bouncer should extend the
`AbstractBounce` class.

#### Quick start

In your PHP project, just add these lines to verify an IP:

```php

<?php
use CrowdSecBouncer\Bouncer;

// Init bouncer
$bouncer = new Bouncer();
$bouncer->configure(['api_key' => 'YOUR_BOUNCER_API_KEY', 'api_url' => 'http://localhost:8080']);

// Ask remediation to API
$remediation = $bouncer->getRemediationForIp($requestedIp);
echo "\nResult: $remediation\n\n"; // "ban", "captcha" or "bypass"
```

#### Test your bouncer

To test your bouncer, you could add decision to ban your own IP for 5 minutes for example:

```bash
cscli decisions add --ip <YOUR_IP> --duration 5m --type ban
```

You can also test a captcha:

```bash
cscli decisions delete --all # be careful with this command!
cscli decisions add --ip <YOUR_IP> --duration 15m --type captcha
```


#### Configurations

You can pass an array of configurations in the `$bouncer->configure($configs)` method.

Here is the list of available settings:

##### LAPI Connection

- `auth_type`: Select from `api_key` and `tls`. Choose if you want to use an API-KEY or a TLS (pki) authentification.
  TLS authentication is only available if you use CrowdSec agent with a version superior to 1.4.0.


- `api_key`: Key generated by the cscli (CrowdSec cli) command like `cscli bouncers add bouncer-php-library`.
  Only required if you choose `api_key` as `auth_type`.


- `tls_cert_path`: absolute path to the bouncer certificate (e.g. pem file).
  Only required if you choose `tls` as `auth_type`.


- `tls_key_path`: Absolute path to the bouncer key (e.g. pem file).
  Only required if you choose `tls` as `auth_type`.


- `tls_verify_peer`: This option determines whether request handler verifies the authenticity of the peer's certificate.
  Only required if you choose `tls` as `auth_type`.
  When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity.
  If `tls_verify_peer` is set to true, request handler verifies whether the certificate is authentic.
  This trust is based on a chain of digital signatures,
  rooted in certification authority (CA) certificates you supply using the `tls_ca_cert_path` setting below.


- `tls_ca_cert_path`: Absolute path to the CA used to process peer verification.
  Only required if you choose `tls` as `auth_type` and `tls_verify_peer` is set to true.


- `api_url`: Define the URL to your LAPI server, default to `http://localhost:8080`.


- `api_timeout`: In seconds. The timeout when calling LAPI. Must be greater or equal than 1. Default to 1 sec.


- `use_curl`: By default, this lib call the REST LAPI using `file_get_contents` method (`allow_url_fopen` is required).
  You can set `use_curl` to `true` in order to use `cURL` request instead (`curl` is in then required)


##### Debug
- `debug_mode`: `true` to enable verbose debug log. Default to `false`.


- `disable_prod_log`: `true` to disable prod log. Default to `false`.


- `log_directory_path`: Absolute path to store log files. Important note: be sur this path won't be publicly
  accessible.


- `display_errors`: true to stop the process and display errors on browser if any.


- `forced_test_ip`: Only for test or debug purpose. Default to empty. If not empty, it will be used instead of the
  real remote ip.


- `forced_test_forwarded_ip`: Only for test or debug purpose. Default to empty. If not empty, it will be used
  instead of the real forwarded ip. If set to `no_forward`, the x-forwarded-for mechanism will not be used at all.

##### Bouncer behavior

- `bouncing_level`:  Select from `bouncing_disabled`, `normal_bouncing` or `flex_bouncing`. Choose if you want to apply CrowdSec directives (Normal bouncing) or be more permissive (Flex bouncing). With the `Flex mode`, it is impossible to accidentally block access to your site to people who don’t deserve it. This mode makes it possible to never ban an IP but only to offer a Captcha, in the worst-case scenario.


- `fallback_remediation`: Select from `bypass` (minimum remediation), `captcha` or `ban` (maximum remediation). Default to 'captcha'. Handle unknown remediations as.


- `max_remediation_level`: Select from `bypass`,`captcha` or `ban`. Default to 'ban'. Cap the
  remediation to the selected one.


- `trust_ip_forward_array`:  If you use a CDN, a reverse proxy or a load balancer, set an array of IPs. For other IPs, the bouncer will not trust the X-Forwarded-For header.


- `excluded_uris`: array of URIs that will not be bounced.

##### Cache

- `cache_system`: Select from `phpfs` (File system cache), `redis` or `memcached`.


- `fs_cache_path`: Will be used only if you choose File system as cache_system. Important note: be sur this path
  won't be publicly accessible.


- `redis_dsn`:   Will be used only if you choose Redis cache as cache_system.


- `memcached_dsn`: Will be used only if you choose Memcached as cache_system.


- `clean_ip_cache_duration`: Set the duration we keep in cache the fact that an IP is clean. In seconds. Defaults to 5.


- `bad_ip_cache_duration`: Set the duration we keep in cache the fact that an IP is bad. In seconds. Defaults to 20.


- `captcha_cache_duration`: Set the duration we keep in cache the captcha flow variables for an IP. In seconds.
  Defaults to 86400.. In seconds. Defaults to 20.


- `geolocation_cache_duration`: Set the duration we keep in cache a geolocation result for an IP . In seconds.
  Defaults to 86400. Depends on the below `geolocation[save_result]` configuration.


- `stream_mode`: true to enable stream mode, false to enable the live mode. Default to false. By default, the `live mode` is enabled. The first time a stranger connects to your website, this mode means that the IP will be checked directly by the CrowdSec API. The rest of your user’s browsing will be even more transparent thanks to the fully customizable cache system. But you can also activate the `stream mode`. This mode allows you to constantly feed the bouncer with the malicious IP list via a background task (CRON), making it to be even faster when checking the IP of your visitors. Besides, if your site has a lot of unique visitors at the same time, this will not influence the traffic to the API of your CrowdSec instance.

##### Geolocation

- `geolocation`: Settings for geolocation remediation (i.e. country based remediation).

- `geolocation[enabled]`: true to enable remediation based on country. Default to false.

- `geolocation[type]`:  Geolocation system. Only 'maxmind' is available for the moment. Default to `maxmind`.


- `geolocation[save_result]`: true to store the geolocalized country in cache. Default to true. Setting true
  will avoid multiple call to the geolocalized system (e.g. maxmind database).

- `geolocation[maxmind]`: MaxMind settings.

- `geolocation[maxmind][database_type]`: Select from `country` or `city`. Default to `country`. These are the two available MaxMind database types.

- `geolocation[maxmind][database_path]`: Absolute path to the MaxMind database (e.g. mmdb file)


##### Captcha and ban wall settings

- `hide_mentions`: true to hide CrowdSec mentions on ban and captcha walls.

- Wording and css settings:

  `theme_color_text_primary`

  `theme_color_text_secondary`

  `theme_color_text_button`

  `theme_color_text_error_message`

  `theme_color_background_page`

  `theme_text_captcha_wall_captcha_placeholder`

  `theme_text_captcha_wall_send_button`

  `theme_text_captcha_wall_error_message`

  `theme_text_captcha_wall_footer`

  `theme_text_ban_wall_tab_title`

  `theme_text_ban_wall_title`

  `theme_text_ban_wall_subtitle`

  `theme_text_ban_wall_footer`


### The Standalone example

This library includes the `StandaloneBounce` class. You can see that class as a good
example for creating your own bouncer. This class extends `AbstractBounce`. All bouncers should do the same. In order to add the bounce logic, you
should first instantiate your bouncer:

```php
use \CrowdSecBouncer\StandaloneBounce
$bounce = new StandaloneBounce();
```
And then, you should initialize the bouncer by passing all the configuration array in a `init` method:

```php
$configs = [...] // @See below for configuration details
$bouncer = $bounce->init($configs)
```

Finally, you can bounce by calling:

```php
$bouncer->run();
```

If you have implemented a `safelyBounce` method (like in `StandaloneBounce` class),
you can just do:

```php
use \CrowdSecBouncer\StandaloneBounce
$bounce = new StandaloneBounce();
$configs = [...] // Retrieve configs from somewhere (database, static file, etc)
$bounce->safelyBounce($configs);
```

To go further and learn how to include this library in your
project, you should follow the [`DEVELOPER GUIDE`](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/php-cs-bouncer/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPER.md).

### Ready to use PHP bouncers

To have a more concrete idea on how to develop a bouncer, you may look at the following bouncers for Magento 2 and
WordPress :
- [CrowdSec Bouncer extension for Magento 2](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-magento-bouncer)
- [CrowdSec Bouncer plugin for WordPress ](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-wordpress-bouncer)


## Installation

### Requirements

- PHP >= 7.2
- required php extensions: `ext-json`, `ext-gd`
- suggested php extension: `ext-curl`

### Library installation

Use `Composer` by simply adding `crowdsec/bouncer` as a dependency:

    composer require crowdsec/bouncer


### Standalone mode installation

This library can also be used on its own so that every browser access to a php script will be bounced.

In order to use the standalone mode, you will have to :

- give the correct permission for the folder that contains the lib

- copy the `scripts/auto-prepend/settings.example.php` to a `scripts/auto-prepend/settings.php` file

- set an `auto_prepend_file` directive in your PHP setup.


#### Files permission

The owner of the `/path/to/the/crowdsec-lib` should be your webserver owner (e.g. `www-data`).

You can achieve it by running command like:

```
sudo chown www-data /path/to/the/crowdsec-lib
```

#### Settings file

Please copy the `scripts/auto-prepend/settings.example.php` to a `scripts/auto-prepend/settings.php`
and fill the necessary settings in it.

#### `auto_prepend_file` directive

We will now describe how to set an `auto_prepend_file` directive in order to call the `scripts/auto-prepend/bounce.php` for each php script access.

Adding an `auto_prepend_file` directive can be done in different ways:

##### `.ini` file

You should add this line to a `.ini` file :

    auto_prepend_file = /absolute/path/to/scripts/auto-prepend/bounce.php

##### Nginx

If you are using Nginx, you should modify your nginx configuration file by adding a `fastcgi_param`
directive. The php block should look like below:

```
location ~ \.php$ {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE "/absolute/path/to/scripts/auto-prepend/bounce.php";
}
```

##### Apache

If you are using Apache, you should add this line to your `.htaccess` file:

    php_value auto_prepend_file "/absolute/path/to/scripts/auto-prepend/bounce.php"
