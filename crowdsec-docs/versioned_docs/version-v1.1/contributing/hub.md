# Contribute to the Hub

## Contributing to the parsers/scenarios

If you want to contribute your parser or scenario to the community and have them appear on the [Crowdsec Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/), you should [open a merge request](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/hub/pulls) on the hub.

We are currently working on a proper [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) for the [Crowdsec Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/), so for now all contribution are subject to peer-review, please bear with us !

## Publishing parsers, scenarios and collections

### Why ?

Sharing your parsers, scenarios and collections on the hub allows other users to find it and use it. While increasing your code's visibility, it ensures as well a benevolent look from the community and the team over it.

### How ?

To have your parser/scenario published on the hub, please simply [open a new issue on the hub](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/hub/issues/new), requesting "parser/scenario inclusion". The configurations will then be reviewed by the team, and then will be published directly on the hub, for everyone to find & use it !
