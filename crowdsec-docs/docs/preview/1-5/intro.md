**We have been working on a new release here at CrowdSec and would love to invite you to join a preview of CrowdSec v1.5.**

If you are willing to test our suite of new features, we would gladly give you full access to them for 2 months as well as kit you out in our exclusive 1.5 beta swag. All we would ask for in return is your feedback, and reports on any bugs or usability issues that you might come across.

Here are a few details about some of the features we are including in 1.5:

- Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring, giving you the ability to monitor and protect your whole K8s cluster and not just the services running on it.

- Third Party Blocklists, allowing you to subscribe to at least 2 (new) additional blocklists created by the CrowdSec team in addition to our community fuelled blocklist to better protect your instances. 

- A new Polling API, giving you the ability to complete real-time decision management within the console. For users with a lot of instances, you can now update all of them from the comfort of a single page, rather than running an automation script to update all instances. A great timesaver for SecOps teams.

- Alert Context, giving you greater insight into alerts provided by your CrowdSec instances. Currently users are provided with the IP, the scenario triggered, and the time of the alert. With this enriched context, users will be able to pick and choose what additional context they can see.

You can find a full list of the changes located [here](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc2)
