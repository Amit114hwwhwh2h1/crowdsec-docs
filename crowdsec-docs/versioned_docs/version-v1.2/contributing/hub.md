# Contribute to the Hub

## Contribute to parsers/scenarios

If you want to contribute by sharing your parser or scenario with the community and make them available on the [Crowdsec Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/), you should [open a merge request](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/hub/pulls) on the Hub.

We are currently working on a proper [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) for the [Crowdsec Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/), so for the time being all contributions are subject to peer-review, please bear with us!

## Publishing parsers, scenarios and collections

### Why?

Sharing your parsers, scenarios and collections on the Hub allows other users to find and use them. While increasing your code's visibility, it also ensures a benevolent look from the community and the team over it.

### How?

To have your parser/scenario published on the Hub, simply [open a new issue on the Hub](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/hub/issues/new), requesting "parser/scenario inclusion". Configurations will then be reviewed by the team and published directly on the Hub, for everyone to find and use them!
